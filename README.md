# project_phaser

Hi Everyone!

Here is my final project for the General Assembly SEI Course.

For my final project I made a shooting game using html, css and javascript on the front end, and rails in the backend. As a requirement for the final project we needed to use a technology that we had not used before. For this I decided to use a javascript framework call Phaser. This framework is primarily used for game development within javascript. It is very helpful because it has a lot of functionality built in to it. Things like gravity, button mapping, and collision are a lot simpler because you do not need to write out all of that code yourself. The Phaser library really help you out! Some of the resources that I used were w3schools, Stackoverflow, tutorials from Phaser's own website and yorkcs, Photonstorm's site (creator of Phaser), and our own class lesson repos.

For deployment of my site I used Heroku and Surge.

In my game you take control of a ship flying through space where you try to avoid enemy ships for as long as possible. There are multiple types of ships coming towards you: gunships, carrier ships, and chaser ships. As soon as the chaser ships get within 320 pixels of the player ship - surprise, surprise - they begin to chase you.

My biggest difficulties with this project was managing my time. I had more ambitous plans of teaching myself Python and building a game with it. That fell through. Then I wanted to build a platformer from scratch. That would have taken way too long because I would have needed to build out all of the logic and the visuals. Then I decided to use a frame work that had logic and visuals built in - which ended up being Phaser.

If I had more time to work on the project I would definitely have styled it more and figured out how to pull the data from the timer to get it display on the scoreboard along with the names. I also would have wanted to design my own sprites to use, as such I'm just using the sprites that are already in the Phaser library.
